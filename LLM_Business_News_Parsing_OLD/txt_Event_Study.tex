\textbf{1. Define the Event and Event Window}

The event in your study is the publication of a news article $i \in \mathcal{D}$ about firms $j \in \mathcal{F}_{\text {IBEX35 }}$. The event date is $\tilde{d}_0^i$, the effective treatment date as defined in your setup.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Event Date: $\tilde{d}_0^i$
  \item Event Window: A period surrounding the event date, typically defined as $\left[\tilde{d}_0^i-k, \tilde{d}_0^i+k\right]$, where $k$ is the number of days before and after the event.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{2. Estimate the Normal Return Model}

To isolate the impact of the event, you need to estimate the normal returns that would have been expected if the event had not occurred. You already have a market model for this:
$$
r_d^j=\alpha^{(i, j)}+\beta^{(i, j)} r_d^M+\epsilon_d^{(i, j)} \quad \forall d \in \mathcal{M}^i
$$
where $\mathcal{M}^i$ is a window before the event date $\tilde{d}_0^i$ used to estimate the parameters $\alpha^{(i, j)}$ and $\beta^{(i, j)}$.


\bx 
\textbf{3. Calculate Abnormal Returns}

The abnormal return (AR) is the difference between the actual return and the normal return:
$$
A R_d^{(i, j)}=r_d^j-\left(\alpha^{(i, j)}+\beta^{(i, j)} r_d^M\right)
$$

\bx 
\textbf{4. Aggregate Abnormal Returns}

To evaluate the overall impact of the event, aggregate the abnormal returns over the event window. This can be done using cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) or average abnormal returns (AAR).
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR):
$$
C A R_{(i, j)}=\sum_{d=\tilde{d}_0^i-k}^{\tilde{d}_0^i+k} A R_d^{(i, j)}
$$
	\item Average Abnormal Returns (AAR) for each day in the event window:
$$
A A R_d=\frac{1}{\left|\mathcal{F}^i\right|} \sum_{j \in \mathcal{F}^i} A R_d^{(i, j)}
$$
\end{itemize}


\bx 
\textbf{5. Statistical Testing}

To determine whether the abnormal returns are statistically significant, perform hypothesis testing on the abnormal returns.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Null Hypothesis $\left(H_0\right)$ : The event has no impact on the stock returns $\left(A R_d^{(i, j)}=0\right)$.
  \item Alternative Hypothesis $\left(H_1\right)$ : The event has an impact on the stock returns $\left(A R_d^{(i, j)} \neq 0\right)$.
\end{itemize}


A common test statistic for this purpose is the t-test.
