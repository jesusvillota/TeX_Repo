%==============[	  Basket Trading  ]==============
Our pairs trading strategy represents a specialized implementation of basket trading, where a synthetic asset is constructed through an optimally weighted basket of securities. The strategy's feasibility rests on several key operational assumptions and market structure considerations that warrant careful examination. The basket's composition demonstrates sophisticated risk distribution across multiple market segments, with our synthetic control comprising 27 assets spanning diverse sectors. Significant long positions in AME (41.08\%), LUV (33.31\%), and TFC (25.60\%) are counterbalanced by strategic shorts in ADSK (-42.25\%) and UNP (-25.77\%), creating a well-diversified exposure structure that provides distinct advantages over traditional single-stock pairs.

This sophisticated composition yields multiple advantages through its sector diversity. By spanning financials, technology, transportation, and other sectors, our approach substantially reduces idiosyncratic risk compared to single-stock pairs, effectively mitigating the impact of company-specific events or sector-wide shocks that typically destabilize simpler pairs trading arrangements. The implementation efficiency is further enhanced by modern execution systems that can treat these 27 components as a single basket order, substantially reducing transaction costs and bid-ask spread impact through optimized order routing.

The practical implementation of this strategy requires careful consideration of several critical operational requirements. Most importantly, the approach necessitates access to sophisticated basket trading capabilities that can handle simultaneous execution of multiple components--a requirement readily met by major institutional brokers offering advanced smart order routing services. To ensure consistent execution quality, all basket components must maintain sufficient liquidity; we addressed this constraint by restricting our universe to S\&P 500 constituents, thereby guaranteeing deep and reliable trading volumes across all components.

The strategy's effectiveness ultimately depends on maintaining strict dollar neutrality through equal but opposite positions in the target and synthetic basket. This market-neutral construction demands precise execution coordination across all components, a challenge effectively addressed by modern electronic trading systems capable of processing complex basket orders as single units. 

%==============[	  Comments on Figure 5  ]==============
\cref{fig:positions_by_copula} illustrates the evolution of position sizes for both target and synthetic assets across different copula specifications over our out-of-sample period from July 2020 to January 2025. For each copula family, the strategy maintains dollar-neutral positions by simultaneously taking offsetting long and short positions in the target (red) and synthetic (blue) assets. Position sizes (in shares) are normalized relative to an initial equity of \$1, with values between -0.2 and 0.2 representing the number of shares allocated to each side of the trade. The parallel movements in the red and blue lines across all panels reflect the strategy's market-neutral construction, where positions are always equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

\cref{tab:copula_performance} reveals the out-of-sample performance across copula specifications. The N14 mixed copula generates the highest total return (77.82\%) and annualized return (17.26\%), while maintaining moderate volatility (4.35\%). This superior performance is reflected in its high Sharpe (3.97) and Sortino (5.75) ratios, matching the Clayton copula's risk-adjusted metrics but with better absolute returns. The Gaussian copula, despite showing the most conservative returns (62.70\%), still achieves respectable risk-adjusted performance with a Sharpe ratio of 3.14, though it lags behind all other specifications.
A particularly noteworthy pattern emerges in the downside risk metrics. The Frank copula, while generating modest returns (66.53\%), exhibits the lowest volatility (3.97\%) and maintains a remarkably low maximum drawdown (1.36\%), suggesting it effectively filters out noisy trading signals. In contrast, the Joe copula shows the highest maximum drawdown (2.57\%) despite having the highest win rate (36.62\%), indicating that its emphasis on upper tail dependence may lead to larger adverse price movements before positions converge. The Student-t copula strikes a balance between these extremes, delivering strong total returns (74.63\%) with moderate maximum drawdown (2.15\%) and a competitive Sharpe ratio (3.60), demonstrating that its symmetric tail dependence effectively captures the risk-return tradeoff inherent in our pairs trading strategy.

\cref{fig:equity_curves_comparison} displays the cumulative returns for our pairs trading strategy across different copula specifications. The performance hierarchy is well-defined throughout the out-of-sample period: the N14 mixed copula consistently outperforms all other specifications, achieving approximately 78\% cumulative return. A second group comprising the Student-t, Clayton, and Gumbel copulas tracks closely together, delivering returns around 73-75\%. Joe and Frank copulas form a third tier with returns near 67\%, while the Gaussian copula lags notably behind all other specifications with about 63\% cumulative return. This ordering largely aligns with the sophistication of tail dependence modeling in each specification, suggesting that more flexible approaches to capturing the joint distribution of target and synthetic returns translate directly into superior trading performance.

\paragraph{Risk-adjusted returns}

For each copula model, we run the  regression
$$
\mathcal{R}_{t}^{c} = \alpha + \b{\beta}' \mbf{f}_t + \eps_t
$$
where 
$\mathcal{R}_{t}^{c}$ are the excess returns of our pairs trading strategy for copula family $c$, and 
$\mbf f_t$ represents a particular combination of the Fama-French factors: 
$\texttt{MKT\_RF}_t$, $\texttt{SMB}_t$, $\texttt{HML}_t$, $\texttt{RMW}_t$, $\texttt{CMA}_t$, $\texttt{MOM}_t$, $\texttt{ST\_REV}_t$, $\texttt{LT\_REV}_t$.
Since we consider combinations of 8 factors, we run $2^8=256$ different regressions for each copula. This delivers a positive significant $\alpha$ of  $0.0004$ -- $0.0006$ for all regressions specifications across all copula models, which is equivalent to an annualized $\alpha$ of $10.08\%$ -- $15.12\%$. The significance of risk-factors varies through copula models. In particular: 
%----------------------------------------------------
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,noitemsep]
  \item Gumbel copula shows limited factor exposure, with only the Size (SMB) factor showing statistical significance and the Value (HML) factor showing mild significance. The Short-term Reversal (ST\_REV) factor exhibits mild significance, although the overall factor model reliability is questionable.
  
  \item Frank copula returns demonstrate significant exposure primarily to the Short-term Reversal (ST\_REV) factor, with other factors showing no consistent statistical significance.
  
  \item Clayton copula strategy returns are significantly exposed to market risk, with MKT\_RF being the sole statistically significant factor across all model specifications.
  
  \item Joe copula exhibits mild sensitivity to market risk, with MKT\_RF showing moderate significance. The single-factor model incorporating only MKT\_RF emerges as the most statistically significant specification.
  
  \item N14 copula returns show significant exposure to the market factor. The model's explanatory power improves notably when incorporating the Short-term Reversal factor.
  
  \item Gaussian copula demonstrates significant exposure to market risk, with the Short-term Reversal factor showing strong statistical significance (significant at the 1\% level). 
  
  \item Student-t copula returns exhibit mild sensitivity to the Profitability factor (RMW), suggesting the potential relevance of a single-factor model focused solely on RMW.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Orthogonal Factor Regression} We follow \cite{alexander2008market} (page 27), to retrieve factor betas in the presence of multicollinearity. 

\textit{\underline{About multicollinearity:}}
\begin{quote}
\footnotesize 
\qquote{
Multicollinearity refers to the correlation between the explanatory variables in a regression model: if one or more explanatory variables are highly correlated, then it is difficult to estimate their regression coefficients. We say that a model has a high degree of multicollinearity if two or more explanatory variables are highly (positively or negatively) correlated. Then, theur regression coefficients cannot be estimated with much precision and, in technical terms, the efficiency of the OLS estimator is reduced. The multicollinearity problem becomes apparetn when the estimated coefficients change considerably when adding another (colinear) variable to the regression. There is no statistical test for multicollinearity, but a useful rule of thumb is that a model will suffer from it if the squareof the pairwise correlation between two explanatory variables is greated than the multiple $R^2$ of the regression.
}
\end{quote}

\textit{\underline{About factor models:}}
\begin{quote}
\footnotesize 
\qquote{
A major problem with estimating fundamental factor models using time series data is that potential factors are very highly correlated. In this case, the factor betas cannot be estimated with precision. [...] Because of the problem with multicollinearity, the only reliable factor beta estimate is one where each factor is taken individually in its own single factor model. But no single factor model can explain the returns on a stock very well. A large part of the stock returns variation will be left to the residual and so the systematic risk will be low and the specific risk high.
}
\end{quote}

\textit{\underline{About solving multicollinearity issues when using factor models:}}
\begin{quote}
\footnotesize 
\qquote{
The best solution to a multicollinearity problem is to apply principal component analysis to all the potential factors and then use the principal components as explanatory variables, instead of the original factors.
}
\end{quote}

\textbf{Modus operandi:}
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
  \item Apply PC to the risk factor returns covariance matrix. This delivers $PC_1,..., PC_M$. 
  \item Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the risk factor covariance matrix. Each PC is represented by a linear combination of factors $PC_m= \sum_{k=1}^K w_{k,m} f_k$, where the weights are given by the eigenvectors.
  \item Regress the returns onto the principal components: $r = \hat \alpha + \sum_{m=1}^M \hat \gamma_m PC_m + \epsilon $
  \item Retrieve the betas as: 
\begin{align*}
r 
&= \hat \alpha + \sum_{m=1}^M \hat \gamma_m PC_m + \epsilon 
\\
&= \hat \alpha + \sum_{m=1}^M \hat \gamma_m \sum_{k=1}^K w_{k,m} f_k + \epsilon 
\\
&= \hat \alpha +  \sum_{k=1}^K f_k \ub{\sum_{m=1}^M \hat \gamma_m w_{k,m}}{=:\beta_k}  + \epsilon 
\\
&= \hat \alpha +  \sum_{k=1}^K \beta_k f_k  + \epsilon 
\end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
where
$$
\beta_k = \sum_{m=1}^M \hat \gamma_m w_{k,m}
$$
Important: In step 2, you should only include in the regression the PCs that have significant coefficients. That is; initially, run the full model $r = \hat \alpha + \sum_{m=1}^M \hat \gamma_m PC_m + \epsilon $ and evaluate the t-statistics of each of the $\gamma_m$'s. Then, select the $\gamma_m$'s with significant t-statistics and run a restricted regression $r = \hat \alpha + \sum_{m\in \mathcal S} \hat \gamma_m PC_m + \epsilon $, where $\mathcal S$ contains the significant PCs. Then, you use the OLS coefficients from the restricted model to retrieve the betas

In my application: 
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,noitemsep]
  \item Obtain the correlation matrix of the factors to check for multicollinearity in the regressions.
  \item If there is multicollinearity, run orthogonal regressions
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,noitemsep]
  \item Create a function that runs an orthogonal regression based on the procedure detailed above for a set of factors provided to the function.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}



\paragraph{Barra Model} The Barra model is a fundamental multi-factor regression model where a stock return is modelled using market and industry risk factor returns and certain fundamental factors called the Barra risk indices. 

The purpose of the Barra model is to analyze the relationship between a portfolio's return and the return on its benchmark. The difference between these two returns is called the relative return (also called the active return). 

Consider a specific portfolio $P$ and its corresponding benchmark $B$. The multi-factor Barra
model applied to this portfolio and its benchmark may be written

\begin{align*}
R_p &= \alpha_P + \beta_P X + \sum_{k=1}^{12} \beta_P^{F,k} R^{F,k} + \sum_{k=1}^{38} \beta_P^{I,k} R^{I,k} + \varepsilon_P,
\\
R_B &= \alpha_B + \beta_B X + \sum_{k=1}^{12} \beta_B^{F,k} R^{F,k} + \sum_{k=1}^{38} \beta_B^{I,k} R^{I,k} + \varepsilon_B,
\end{align*}

with the following notation:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,noitemsep]
  \item $X$ : return on the market index
  \item $R^{F,k}$ : return on the $k$th (standardized) risk index;
  \item $R^{I,k}$ : return on the $k$th industry index;
  \item $\alpha_P$ : portfolio alpha;
  \item $\alpha_B$ : benchmark alpha ($= 0$ if benchmark is market index);
  \item $\beta_P$ : portfolio market beta;
  \item $\beta_B$ : benchmark market beta ($= 1$ if benchmark is market index);
  \item $\beta_P^{F,k}$ : portfolio fundamental beta on the $k$th (standardized) risk index;
  \item $\beta_B^{F,k}$ : benchmark fundamental beta ($= 0$ if benchmark is market index);
  \item $\beta_P^{I,i}$ : portfolio beta on the $i$th industry index;
  \item $\beta_B^{F,i}$ : benchmark beta on the $i$th industry index ($= 0$ if benchmark is market index);
  \item $\varepsilon_P$ : portfolio specific return;
  \item $\alpha_B$ : benchmark specific return ($= 0$ if benchmark is market index).
\end{itemize}

In more concise matrix notation the model may be written
\begin{align*}
R_P &= \alpha_P + \beta_P X + (\beta_P^F)^{\prime} \mathbf{R}^F + (\beta_P^I)^{\prime} \mathbf{R}^I + \varepsilon_P,
\\
R_B &= \alpha_B + \beta_B X + (\beta_B^F)^{\prime} \mathbf{R}^F + (\beta_B^I)^{\prime} \mathbf{R}^I + \varepsilon_B.
\end{align*}

where $(\beta_P^F)^{\prime} = (\beta_P^{F,1}, \ldots, \beta_P^{F,12})$ and the other vector notation follows analogously.

The active return on the portfolio is then defined as 
$$
Y = R_P - R_B = (\alpha_P - \alpha_B) + (\beta_P - \beta_B) X + (\beta_P^F - \beta_B^F)^{\prime} \mathbf{R}^F + (\beta_P^I - \beta_B^I)^{\prime} \mathbf{R}^I + (\varepsilon_P - \varepsilon_B)
$$
Now defining the \textit{relative alpha} as $\alpha = \alpha_P - \alpha_B$ and the \textit{relative betas} as
$$
\beta = \beta_P - \beta_B, \quad \beta^F = \beta_P^F - \beta_B^F \quad \text{and} \quad \beta^I = \beta_P^I - \beta_B^I
$$
and setting $\varepsilon = \varepsilon_P - \varepsilon_B$ we may write the model in terms of the portfolio's active return as:
$$
Y = \alpha + \beta X + \beta^{F\prime}\mathbf{R}^F + \beta^{I\prime}\mathbf{R}^I + \varepsilon.
$$
