\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

In this section, we present the empirical results of our analysis, testing the hypotheses outlined in Section \ref{sec:theoretical}. We begin by providing descriptive statistics of the key variables, followed by the results of the baseline regression model. We then discuss the interaction effects between the LLM-generated news scores, relationship lending, and bank specialization. Finally, we perform robustness checks to validate the findings.

\subsection{Descriptive Statistics}

Table \ref{tab:descriptives} presents the descriptive statistics for the main variables used in the analysis. The average $S_{news}$ score, derived from the LLM analysis of news articles, indicates the overall distribution of news sentiment across firms. On average, firms in the sample have established relationships with banks, as indicated by the relationship lending variable. Additionally, sector specialization among banks varies significantly, with some banks focusing heavily on specific sectors and others maintaining a diversified lending portfolio.

\end{table}

The descriptive statistics provide an overview of the sample, with a mean $S_{news}$ score suggesting a modest overall negative sentiment in the business news analyzed. Around 67\% of the firms in the dataset have established lending relationships, while bank specialization, as measured by the proportion of lending concentrated in specific sectors, ranges from highly diversified banks to highly specialized ones.

\subsection{Baseline Results}

Table \ref{tab:baseline} reports the results of the baseline fixed-effects regression model, testing how loan terms respond to the news score, relationship lending, and bank specialization. The key coefficients of interest are those on $S_{news}$, the interaction between $S_{news}$ and relationship lending, and the interaction between $S_{news}$ and bank specialization.

\end{table}

The results suggest that negative news scores ($S_{news}$) have a significant impact on loan terms. Specifically, a more negative news sentiment leads to a reduction in loan amounts and maturity, while increasing interest rates and collateral requirements. However, this effect is moderated by relationship lending and bank specialization.

\subsubsection{Effect of Relationship Lending}

The interaction between $S_{news}$ and relationship lending is positive and significant, indicating that banks with established lending relationships react less strongly to negative news. Specifically, these banks are more likely to maintain or even increase loan amounts and maturity, while keeping interest rates and collateral requirements relatively stable. This supports \textbf{Hypothesis 2}, which posits that relationship lenders place less weight on negative public signals.

\subsubsection{Effect of Bank Specialization}

The interaction between $S_{news}$ and sector specialization is also positive and significant, suggesting that specialized banks are more capable of distinguishing between transitory and permanent shocks. These banks exhibit a more tempered response to negative news compared to non-specialized banks, lending support to \textbf{Hypothesis 3}. Specialized banks are less likely to reduce loan amounts or increase interest rates in response to news, particularly if they perceive the shock as transitory.

\subsection{Robustness Checks}

To validate the baseline results, we conduct a series of robustness checks, the results of which are presented in Table \ref{tab:robustness}. 

\subsubsection{Alternative Measures of News Sentiment}

We re-estimate the baseline model using alternative sentiment analysis methods, such as a sentiment dictionary-based approach. The results remain consistent with the baseline findings, confirming that the effect of negative news on loan terms is robust to the choice of sentiment analysis technique.

\subsubsection{Placebo Tests}

We perform placebo tests by randomly assigning news dates to firms. The results show no significant changes in loan terms, indicating that the observed effects are indeed driven by the actual timing of news articles.

\subsubsection{Firm and Bank Fixed Effects}

To control for unobserved heterogeneity, we include firm and bank fixed effects in the regression models. The results remain robust, confirming that the relationship between news sentiment, relationship lending, and bank specialization is not driven by time-invariant firm or bank characteristics.

Firm and Bank Fixed Effects & -5.05*** & 0.43*** & 0.13*** & -2.20** \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Summary of Findings}

The results confirm our key hypotheses:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Transactional lenders (without private information) react strongly to negative public signals, significantly tightening credit terms in response to negative news.
    \item Relationship lenders, on the other hand, place less weight on negative news due to their access to private information about the firm.
    \item Sector-specialized banks are better able to differentiate between transitory and permanent shocks, allowing them to respond more cautiously to negative public signals.
\end{itemize}

The robustness checks support the validity of the findings, reinforcing the conclusion that relationship lending and sector specialization significantly moderate the credit implications of negative news.
