\subcaption*{\textit{Note: Portfolio statistics of the trading strategy based on clusters obtained from applying KMeans to article embeddings. The statistics provided are: Cumulative Return, Average Return, Standard Deviation and Sharpe Ratio, which have been computed in accordance to the formulas provided in the text. Such statistics are provided for both cluster-selection algorithms: Greedy and Stable. The Greedy algorithm longs (shorts) clusters that maximize (minimize) the cluster-average-$SR$ in the validation sample subject to a positivity (negativity) constraint, while the Stable algorithm longs (shorts) clusters that minimize the rank difference between the training and validation rankings of the cluster-average-$SR$'s subject to a positivity (negativity) constraint, which is now imposed on both sample splits. In both algorithms, the cardinality of each leg is upper-bounded by a hyperparameter $\theta$. 
The holding period of the beta-neutral positions is set to $L$ = 4 trading days and the number of traded clusters is, $\theta = 0.5k=13$ as there are $k^*=26$ KMeans clusters of article embeddings. The selection criteria for these hyperparameters ($L,\theta$) is based on maximizing the Sharpe Ratios of the train and validation samples.
