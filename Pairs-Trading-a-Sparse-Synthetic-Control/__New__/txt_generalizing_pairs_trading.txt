\paragraph{Generalizing Pairs Trading}
However, the essence of the idea--trading the spread between two assets that are related-- can be generalized. We could take a stock, say, General Motors, and instead of looking for another stock whose \textit{normalized} price series behaves similarly to that of General Motors, we could simply try to reconstruct the \textit{normalized} price series of General Motors as a linear combination of those of other stocks. That is, a simple linear regression where we regress the price of General Motors onto the prices of a selection of assets would allow us to closely replicate the price of the first. 

Similar to traditional pairs trading, this idea is also rooted in asst pricing theory. In particular, in the framework of relative pricing, where we consider that two securities are close substitutes to each other. In the case of pairs trading, we try to find one stock which could deem as "substitute" of the target stock, whereas my idea is more flexible, ins the sense that it allows to construct a synthetic substitute from a linear combination of other stocks. In either case, the mission of finding a substitute can be relaxed by not imposing such a severe cardinality constrain! Note that in the case of pairs trading, we impose a severe cardinality constraint where we limit the reconstruction of the substitue of a target asset to a unique other asset. However, if we relax this constraint and allow ourselved to find such a substitute using more assets, we can create a synthetic replica of the original stock, such that the spread between the original asset and its replica satisfies some nice and desirable properties for profitable trading. In particular, we know that the residual in an OLS regression has 0 mean by construction in the formation sample, if we exploit the estimates of the OLS regression out of sample for a reduced time period, we can hope that those residuals maintain those nice properties, and hence, we could trade the regression residual by betting on it mean reversion to 0.


Hence, this paper proposes a novel framework rooted in asset pricing theory to pairs trade a target asset against a synthetic replica built as a linear combination of other stocks. Because trading a large pool of assets is costly, we obviously want to limit the cardinality of the donor pool of assets that constitute the replica. Pairs trading is the extreme case, where such cardinality constraint is set equal to 1. We propose a more flexible framework where we impose a lasso penalty on the OLS regression to promote sparsity in our solution, without restricting the solution with hard cardinality constraints. Lasso has some nice properties and is ideal in this context, where we aim to select the stocks that contribute the most to the replication of the target asset without the curse of dimensionality of using too many assets, which would turn our trading strategy unfeasible. 

Our methodology replicates the core application from Gatev et al, and adapts it to the case where the cardinality constraint in the lookup for a substitute of the target asset is relaxed.

\paragraph{Generalizing Pairs Trading: From Pairs to Sparse Synthetic Replicas}

The decay in profitability of the classic pairs trade, however, does not necessarily invalidate the underlying principle of relative-value arbitrage. Rather, it suggests that the traditional one-to-one pairing constraint may be too restrictive for modern, complex markets where simple, stable relationships between two individual stocks have become fragile and scarce. The core insight of pairs trading--that a security's value can be assessed relative to a close substitute--remains powerful. The challenge lies in identifying or creating a more robust substitute.

This paper proposes a generalization of the pairs trading framework that relaxes this rigid cardinality constraint. Instead of searching for a single, naturally occurring substitute for a target asset (e.g., General Motors), we propose to \textit{construct} a `synthetic replica' of it. Methodologically, this is achieved by regressing the normalized price series of the target asset against a broad ``donor pool'' of potential substitutes. The fitted values from this regression form the price series of the synthetic replica--a portfolio of assets weighted to best track the target. The spread in this generalized framework is therefore the regression residual: the difference between the target asset's price and the value of its synthetic replica. By construction, this spread has a mean of zero within the formation period. The trading strategy then bets on the out-of-sample persistence of this mean-reverting behavior, shorting the target asset when the residual is positive (i.e., the target is overpriced relative to its replica) and going long when it is negative.

A crucial challenge, however, is that an unconstrained Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression using a large donor pool would yield a dense synthetic replica, composed of hundreds of assets. Such a portfolio would be prohibitively expensive to trade due to transaction costs and slippage, rendering the strategy impractical and suffering from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome this, we introduce a penalized regression approach using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). The LASSO penalty is ideally suited for this context as it promotes sparsity by forcing the coefficients of less relevant assets in the donor pool to exactly zero. This technique simultaneously performs automated variable selection and estimates the weights for the synthetic replica, effectively identifying the most important constituents for creating a parsimonious, and therefore tradable, hedge. 

Our methodology adapts the core formation and trading period structure of \cite{Gatev2006} to this sparse, synthetic framework. We re-examine whether this more flexible and robust form of pairs trading--trading an asset against its sparse synthetic counterpart--can restore profitability in the modern era.

\paragraph{From Pairs to Sparse Synthetic Spreads}

Classic pairs trading insists on finding a \emph{single} security that serves as a near-perfect substitute for a target stock.  Conceptually, this is an extreme--and often unnecessary--cardinality restriction.  Asset-pricing theory suggests a broader perspective: if two assets are close substitutes, then \emph{any} linear combination of sufficiently similar assets should proxy for the target's fundamental value.  We therefore recast the problem as one of constructing a \emph{synthetic replica}.  Let $P_{i,t}$ denote the (normalised) price of a focal stock $i$ at time $t$ and let $\mathbf{P}_{-i,t}$ collect the same-period prices of all candidate donor stocks.  Over a rolling formation window we estimate

\[
P_{i,t}= \alpha_{i} + \mathbf{P}_{-i,t}^\top \boldsymbol{\beta}_{i} + \varepsilon_{i,t},
\]

where the residual $\varepsilon_{i,t}$ represents the instantaneous spread between the target and its replica.  By construction, $\mathbb{E}[\varepsilon_{i,t}]=0$ in-sample; if the linear relationship is sufficiently stable, out-of-sample residuals should exhibit mean reversion that can be exploited exactly as in traditional pairs trading.

Trading the full donor universe, however, would be prohibitively expensive.  Instead of imposing the hard constraint $\|\boldsymbol{\beta}_{i}\|_{0}=1$ (the classic ``pair''), we promote \emph{sparsity} through an $\ell_{1}$ (lasso) penalty:

\[
\min_{\alpha_{i},\boldsymbol{\beta}_{i}}\;
\sum_{t\in\mathcal{F}} \bigl(P_{i,t}-\alpha_{i}-\mathbf{P}_{-i,t}^\top\boldsymbol{\beta}_{i}\bigr)^{2} 
\;+\;\lambda\|\boldsymbol{\beta}_{i}\|_{1},
\]

where $\mathcal{F}$ is the formation window and $\lambda$ controls the trade-off between tracking precision and turnover.  The lasso retains only the most informative donors, delivering a replica that is both parsimonious and cheap to implement while avoiding the curse of dimensionality.

\paragraph{Contribution}

Our study extends the canonical framework of \cite{Gatev2006} in two directions.  First, we relax the 1-for-1 matching rule and allow the data to choose a small but flexible basket of substitutes.  Second, by embedding this choice in a penalised regression we obtain closed-form trading weights and an automatically mean-reverting spread.  Empirically, we show that the resulting sparse synthetic trades (i) dominate traditional pairs on risk-adjusted performance, (ii) remain profitable in the post-2010 environment where classic pairs have largely decayed, and (iii) exhibit markedly lower execution costs thanks to built-in hedge-ratio scaling.  In short, widening the search from ``a partner'' to ``a minimal ensemble'' revives the economic appeal of relative-value convergence trades without sacrificing their celebrated market-neutral profile.

%==============[	  o3 High  ]==============

\paragraph{From traditional pairs to sparse synthetic twins}

The economic intuition behind pairs trading--exploit temporary mispricing between two close substitutes--can be cast more generally as a problem of \emph{relative valuation}.  Rather than forcing the substitute for a target stock \(i\) to be a \emph{single} partner, we allow it to be a \emph{synthetic twin}: a linear combination of many candidate securities whose joint price path mimics that of \(i\).

Formally, let \(P_{i,t}\) denote the (normalized) price of the target asset and \(P_{-i,t}\) the vector of prices for \(N\) potential donor stocks.  On a formation window \(\mathcal T_\text{train}\) we estimate

\[
\min_{w}\;
\sum_{t\in\mathcal T_\text{train}}
\bigl(P_{i,t}-w^\top P_{-i,t}\bigr)^2
\;+\;\lambda\lVert w\rVert_1,
\]

where the $\ell_1$ penalty \(\lambda\lVert w\rVert_1\) (i) shrinks dispensable weights toward zero, (ii) delivers a \emph{sparse} replicating portfolio, and (iii) nests the classic pairs trade as the limiting case in which exactly one weight is non-zero.  The resulting residual
\(
e_{i,t}=P_{i,t}-\hat w^\top P_{-i,t}
\)
has mean zero in sample by construction and, if the replication remains adequate out of sample, should display mean reversion around zero--precisely the property required for spread trading.

The appeal of this framework is threefold.  
1. \textbf{Flexibility.}  By relaxing the hard cardinality constraint, we can capture substitutes that no single stock can provide, yet still avoid an unwieldy, high-turnover hedge.  
2. \textbf{Cost control.}  The $\ell_1$ penalty automatically limits the number of positions, sidestepping the transaction-cost explosion that would plague a dense factor-replication scheme.  
3. \textbf{Theoretical continuity.}  The approach sits comfortably within the relative-pricing view of asset pricing: two portfolios with nearly identical risk exposures should, absent frictions, command nearly identical prices.

In what follows we adapt Gatev et al.'s empirical protocol to this sparse-synthetic setting, document how the choice of \(\lambda\) shapes the trade-off between tracking error and implementability, and evaluate whether any residual profitability survives in the 2010-2024 sample.

\section{A Sparse Synthetic Approach to Pairs Trading}

The decline of traditional pairs trading profitability raises a fundamental question: can the core insight behind the strategy be preserved while adapting to modern market conditions? This paper proposes that the answer lies in generalizing the pairs trading framework beyond its restrictive one-to-one matching constraint.

\subsection{From Pairs to Synthetic Replicas}

Traditional pairs trading imposes a severe cardinality constraint by limiting the replication of a target asset to a single substitute security. This restriction, while conceptually elegant, may be unnecessarily limiting in practice. Consider General Motors: rather than searching for a single stock whose normalized price series closely tracks GM's movements, we could construct a synthetic replica using a linear combination of multiple securities. This approach maintains the fundamental economic intuition of pairs trading--exploiting temporary deviations between economically related assets--while providing greater flexibility in replica construction.

The theoretical foundation remains rooted in relative pricing theory, where securities serving as close economic substitutes should exhibit similar price dynamics. However, our framework relaxes the stringent requirement that such substitution be achieved through a single asset. Instead, we allow for the construction of synthetic substitutes through sparse linear combinations, potentially capturing more nuanced economic relationships that span multiple securities.

\subsection{Methodology: Sparse Synthetic Replica Construction}

Our approach centers on constructing synthetic replicas through regularized regression. For a target asset, we estimate:

$$r_{i,t} = \alpha + \sum_{j \in \mathcal{D}} \beta_j r_{j,t} + \epsilon_{i,t}$$

where $r_{i,t}$ represents the return on the target asset, $\mathcal{D}$ denotes the donor pool of potential replicating assets, and $\epsilon_{i,t}$ captures the residual spread between the target and its synthetic replica.

To promote sparsity while avoiding hard cardinality constraints, we employ LASSO regularization:

$$\min_{\beta} \left\{ \sum_{t=1}^{T} \left( r_{i,t} - \sum_{j \in \mathcal{D}} \beta_j r_{j,t} \right)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j \in \mathcal{D}} |\beta_j| \right\}$$

The LASSO penalty serves dual purposes: it automatically selects the most relevant securities for replication while maintaining computational tractability. This approach naturally balances replication quality against implementation complexity, addressing the practical constraint that trading numerous positions becomes prohibitively costly.

\subsection{Economic Intuition and Trading Strategy}

The trading strategy exploits the mean-reverting properties of regression residuals. By construction, the residual $\epsilon_{i,t}$ has zero mean over the formation period. Our strategy assumes this property persists out-of-sample over shorter horizons, allowing us to profit from temporary deviations by betting on mean reversion toward zero.

When the residual becomes significantly positive (negative), indicating the target asset is overvalued (undervalued) relative to its synthetic replica, we short (long) the target while taking offsetting long (short) positions in the replica components. This maintains the market-neutral characteristic that made traditional pairs trading attractive while potentially improving replication quality through the use of multiple securities.

\subsection{Advantages Over Traditional Pairs Trading}

Our framework offers several potential advantages over traditional pairs trading:

\textbf{Enhanced Flexibility:} By relaxing cardinality constraints, we can capture complex economic relationships that may not be adequately represented by single-stock pairs.

\textbf{Improved Replication Quality:} Multiple securities may provide superior replication of target asset dynamics compared to single-stock matches, potentially leading to more reliable mean reversion patterns.

\textbf{Automatic Selection:} LASSO regularization provides principled asset selection without requiring ad-hoc similarity metrics or arbitrary cutoff rules.

\textbf{Scalability:} The framework naturally extends to different asset classes and can accommodate varying degrees of sparsity through the regularization parameter.

This methodology represents a natural evolution of the pairs trading concept, maintaining its core economic intuition while adapting to the realities of modern, increasingly efficient markets. The following sections detail our empirical implementation and assess whether this generalized approach can restore profitability to spread-based trading strategies.

\section{A Sparse Synthetic Replica Approach}

The documented decline of traditional pairs trading profitability raises a fundamental question: can we revitalize this market-neutral strategy by relaxing its inherent constraints? While the classical approach of pairing individual securities may no longer yield sustainable returns, the underlying economic intuition--that relative mispricings between fundamentally related assets create profit opportunities--remains compelling.

Traditional pairs trading imposes a severe cardinality constraint by requiring that each target asset be paired with exactly one substitute. This restriction, while elegant in its simplicity, may be unnecessarily limiting in modern markets where complex interdependencies exist among securities. We propose a natural generalization that relaxes this constraint: instead of seeking a single stock that mimics the behavior of our target asset, we construct a \textit{synthetic replica} using a sparse linear combination of multiple securities.

\subsection{Theoretical Foundation}

Our approach builds on the relative pricing framework that underlies traditional pairs trading. In classical pairs trading, the fundamental assumption is that two securities serve as close economic substitutes, and temporary deviations from their equilibrium relationship create arbitrage opportunities. We extend this logic by recognizing that a target security's price dynamics can often be more accurately replicated through a portfolio of multiple assets rather than a single substitute.

Formally, consider a target asset $i$ with normalized price series $P_i(t)$. Rather than identifying a single asset $j$ such that $P_i(t) \approx P_j(t)$, we seek to construct a synthetic replica:

$$P_i(t) \approx \sum_{j \in \mathcal{D}} \beta_j P_j(t) + \epsilon_i(t)$$

where $\mathcal{D}$ represents our donor pool of potential replicating assets, $\beta_j$ are the replication weights, and $\epsilon_i(t)$ is the tracking error between the target and its synthetic replica.

The economic intuition mirrors that of traditional pairs trading: if our synthetic replica accurately captures the fundamental value drivers of the target asset, then deviations $\epsilon_i(t)$ should exhibit mean-reverting properties, creating opportunities for profitable arbitrage.

\subsection{Sparse Replication via LASSO}

The key innovation lies in our approach to constructing the synthetic replica. While we could theoretically use all available assets as potential donors, doing so would create several practical challenges: high transaction costs, portfolio complexity, and potential overfitting to in-sample relationships. Moreover, economic theory suggests that most securities are driven by a relatively small number of fundamental factors, implying that a sparse representation should be both feasible and economically meaningful.

We address these challenges by employing LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regularization when estimating the replication weights $\beta_j$. This approach offers several advantages over traditional methods:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Automatic variable selection}: LASSO naturally selects the most relevant donor assets while setting coefficients for irrelevant securities to zero
    \item \textbf{Sparsity without hard constraints}: Unlike imposing arbitrary cardinality limits, LASSO allows the data to determine the optimal number of replicating assets
    \item \textbf{Regularization}: The penalty term helps prevent overfitting to in-sample relationships
    \item \textbf{Computational efficiency}: Modern optimization algorithms make LASSO estimation feasible even with large donor pools
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Trading Strategy Implementation}

Our trading strategy operates on the premise that the regression residual $\epsilon_i(t)$ from our sparse synthetic replica should exhibit mean-reverting properties. During the formation period, we estimate the LASSO regression:

$$\min_{\boldsymbol{\beta}} \left\{ \frac{1}{2} \left\| P_i - \mathbf{P}_{\mathcal{D}} \boldsymbol{\beta} \right\|_2^2 + \lambda \left\| \boldsymbol{\beta} \right\|_1 \right\}$$

where $\mathbf{P}_{\mathcal{D}}$ is the matrix of normalized prices for our donor assets, and $\lambda$ controls the degree of sparsity. By construction, the estimated residuals have zero mean during the formation period.

During the subsequent trading period, we monitor the out-of-sample tracking error between the target asset and its synthetic replica. When this error deviates significantly from zero, we establish positions betting on mean reversion: going long the target asset and short the synthetic replica when the target appears undervalued relative to its replica, and vice versa.

This framework represents a natural evolution of the pairs trading concept, where the classical approach with cardinality constraint equal to one becomes a special case of our more general sparse replication methodology. By allowing the data to determine the optimal degree of sparsity, we aim to capture more complex relationships while maintaining the market-neutral characteristics that made pairs trading attractive to practitioners.

The following sections detail our empirical implementation, examine the performance of this approach using the same dataset as \cite{Gatev2006}, and assess whether this generalization can restore profitability to the pairs trading framework in contemporary markets.



%----------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Data snooping and market response}
As in Gatev, we also have abstracted away from searching over the full strategy space to identify successful trading rules. Instead, we have adapted the same parameterization and rules proposed by Gatev. In their paper, Gatev et al argue that their rules follow the feneral outline:

\begin{itemize}
\item First. \qquote{\bblue{Find stocks that move together}}. In traditional pairs trading this is done by finding two ``real'' pairs. In our case, this is done by constructing a synthetic replica of a target asset.
\item Second. \qquote{\bblue{Take a long-short position when they diverge and unwind on convergence}}. In our case, this is equivalent to betting on the mean reversion of the regression residual. That is, we go short when the regression error is positive, and long otherwise.
\end{itemize}



Similar to Gatev et al, we account for transaction costs indirectly by waiting one day after the signal from the pairs trade is derived. 



%----------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Relative pricing}
% Rooting the idea in Asset Pricing theory
Asset pricing can be viewed in absolute and relative terms. 

\begin{itemize}
\item \bblue{Absolute pricing values securities from fundamentals such as discounted future cash flow. This is a notoriously diffucult process with a wide margin for error.}
\item \bblue{Relative pricing is only slightly easier. Relative pricing means that two securities that are close substitutes for each other should sell for the same price --it does not say what that price will be. Thus, relative pricing allows for bubbles in the economy, but not necessarily arbitrage or profitable speculation. The Law of One Price [LOP] and a ``near-LOP'' are applicable to relative pricing, even if that price is wrong.}
\begin{itemize}
\item \bblue{Ingersoll (1987) defines the LOP as the ``proposition ... that two investments with the same payoff in every state of nature must have the same current value.'' In other words, two securities with the same prices in all states of the world should sell for the same amount.}
\item \bblue{Chen and Knez (1995) extend this to argue that ``closely integrated markets should assign to similar payoffs prices that are close''. They argue that two securities with similar, but not necessarily, matching payoffs across states should have similar prices. This is of course a weaker condition and subject to bounds on prices for unusual states; however, it allows the examination of ``near-efficient'' economies, or in Chen and Knez' case, near integrated
markets. Notice that this theory corresponds to the desire to find two
stocks whose prices move together as long as we can define states of
nature as the time series of observed historical trading days.} In traditional pairs trading, we need to find two stocks with near-matching payoffs, which is of a complicated nature due to the fact that we are restricted to exclusively one. On the other hand, finding a matching payoff from a combination of assets is much easier. In a near efficient economy (i.e.: if markets are integrated), the price of the target asset should match that of its synthetic replica.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

From a relative pricing framework, pairs trading can be thought of as fixing one stock and finding the associated replicating portfolio (i.e: a portfolio constructed in a way such that it delivers the same payoffs as the target stock). Then, the idea is to trade against pricing deviations between the target and replicating portfolio, since, by the LOP, both assets' price should evolve in the same way. In traditional pairs trading, for a target stock, we aim to find the associated replicating portfolio in another stock. Ideally, the best type of pair would be the same stock traded in different exchanges, then, the payoffs are exactly the same, and arbitrageurs can trade profitably to enforce the LOP. In a more general way, a pair is found by looking in normalized cum-dividend price space and matching a target stock to a another stock whose price time series is very close to that of the target stock (i.e: find the stock whose price time series minimizes some distance metric with respect to the target price time series). However, nothing prevents us from finding more sophisticated replicating portfolio, that do not rely on a single asset to replicate the target stock price dynamics. Instead, one can find a replicating stock in a linear combination from a set of donor stocks. In particular, by running a regression in which we regress the target stock price dynamics onto the price span of the donor pool, we can find the linear combination of assets that best replicates the price dynamics of the target asset. Besides, such linear regression will have some desirable properties such as a 0--mean in the residual error or spread in-sample, which is the object of trading in a pairs trading strategy. In other words, we have the desirable mean-reversion in the spread.


\paragraph{Co-integrated prices}

As mentioned in Gatev et al, \bblue{the pairs trading strategy may be justified within an equilibrium asset-pricing framework with nonstationary common factors like Bossaerts and Green (1989) and Jagannathan and Viswanathan (1988).}

% WORK IN UNDERSTANDING THIS
\bblue{If the long and short components fluctuate with common nonstationary factors, then the prices of the component portfolios would be co-integrated and the pairs trading strategy would be expected to work. Evidence of exposures to common nonstationary factors would support a nonstationary factor pricing framework.

The space of normalized, cum-dividend prices, that is, cumulative total returns with dividends reinvested, is the basic space for the pairs trading strategies in this article. The main observation about our motivating models of the CAPM-APT variety is that they are known to imply perfect collinearity of prices, which is readily rejected by the data. On the other hand, Bossaerts (1988) finds evidence of price co-integration for the U.S. stock market. We would like to keep the notion of the empirically observed co-movement of prices, without unnecessarily restrictive assumptions, hence we proceed in the spirit of the co-integrated prices literature.


More specifically, our matching in price space can be interpreted as follows. Suppose that prices obey a statistical model of the form
$$
p_{i t}=\sum \beta_{i l} p_{l t}+\varepsilon_{i t},
k<n
$$
where $\varepsilon_{i t}$ denotes a weakly dependent error in the sense of Bossaerts (1988). Assume also that $p_{i t}$ is weakly dependent after differencing once. Under these assumptions, the price vector $\boldsymbol{p}_{\boldsymbol{t}}$ is co-integrated of order 1 with cointegrating rank $r=n-k$, in the sense of Engle and Granger (1987) and Bossaerts (1988). Thus, there exist $r$ linearly independent vectors $\left\{\boldsymbol{\alpha}_q\right\}_{q=1, \ldots, r}$ such that $z_q=\boldsymbol{\alpha}_q{ }^{\prime} \boldsymbol{p}_t$ are weakly dependent. In other words, $r$ linear combinations of prices will not be driven by the $k$ common nonstationary components $p_l$. Note that this interpretation does not imply that the market is inefficient, rather it says that certain assets are weakly redundant, so that any deviation of their price from a linear combination of the prices of other assets is expected to be temporary and reverting.

To interpret the pairs as co-integrated prices, we need to assume that for $n \gg k$, there are co-integrating vectors that have only two nonzero coordinates. In that case, the sum or difference of scaled prices will be reverting to zero and a trading rule could be constructed to exploit the expected temporary deviations. Our strategy relies on exactly this conclusion. In principle one could construct trading strategies with trios, quadruples, and so on of stocks, which would presumably capture more co-integrated prices and would yield better profits.
}

This paper constitutes an extension of pairs trading and an empirical investigation of this last statement in Gatev et al. If prices are really cointegrated, as found in Bossaerts (1988), then, any deviation of the prices from this cointegration relationship should allow us to trade profitably by betting against that deviation.


In pairs trading, the cointegration vector in the universe of assets takes the form of a vector of zeros with two elements taking the value 1 and -1.  For a target asset $i$, its associated cointegration vector is $\boldsymbol \alpha_{i} = \mbf e_i-\mbf e_j$, where $j$ is its best maching stock in normalized price space and $\mbf e_{\ell}$ is the canonical vector which takes the value 1 at position $\ell$ and zeros elsewhere. Imposing this structure in the cointegration vector is too restrictive. Indeed, it should be simpler to find cointegration in a more general framework such as the one proposed in this paper. In our case, the cointegration vector corresponds to $\boldsymbol \alpha = \mbf e_i + \boldsymbol \beta_i$, where $\boldsymbol \beta_i$ is the regression coefficient vector in the regression of normalized target prices onto normalized donor prices:
$p_{it} = \sum_{l\neq i}\beta_i p_{\ell t} + \veps_{it}$. 

\section{Methodology}

The methodology of this paper follows \cite{Gatev2006}. \bblue{We implement pairs trading in two stages. We form pairs over a 12-month period (formation period) and trade them in the next 6-month period (trading period).}

\bblue{In each pairs formation period, we screen out all stocks from the CRSP daily files that have one or more days with no trade. This serves to identify relatively liquid stocks as well as to facilitate pairs formation. Next, we construct a cumulative total returns index for each stock over the formation period.}

We then find the replicating portfolio for each target stock by finding the linear combination of security prices that minimizes the sum of squared deviations between the two normalized price series. \bblue{Pairs are thus formed by exhaustive matching in in normalized daily ``price'' space, where price includes reinvested dividends.}

%\bblue{Once we have paired up all liquid stocks in the formation period, we study the top 5 and 20 pairs with the smallest historical distance measure, in addition to the 20 pairs after the top 100 (pairs 101-120).}

As in \cite{Do2010} we focus on the top 20 pairs. 
\bblue{On the day following the last day of the pairs formation period, we begin to trade according to a prespecified rule.}
\bblue{We select trading rules based on the proposition that we open a long-
short position when the pair prices have diverged by a certain amount and
close the position when the prices have reverted}
\bblue{webase our rules for opening and closing positions on a standard deviation metric. We open a position in a pair when prices diverge by more than two historical standard deviations, as estimated during the pairs formation period. We unwind the position at the next crossing of the prices. If prices do not cross before the end of the trading interval, gains or losses are calculated at the end of the last trading day of the trading interval. If a stock in a pair is delisted from CRSP, we close the position in that pair, using the delisting return, or the last available price}
\bblue{We report the payoffs by going one dollar short in the higher-priced stock and one dollar long in the lower-priced stock}

\bblue{Pairs that open and converge during the trading
interval will have positive cash flows. Because pairs can reopen after initial convergence, they can have multiple positive cash flows during the trading interval. Pairs that open but do not converge will only have cash flows on the last day of the trading interval when all positions are closed out. Therefore, the payoffs to pairs trading strategies are a set of positive cash flows that are randomly distributed throughout the trading period, and a set of cash flows at the end of the trading interval that can be either positive or negative. For each pair we can have multiple cash flows during the trading interval, or we may have none in the case when prices never diverge by more than two standard deviations during the trading interval. Because the trading gains and losses are computed over long-short positions of one dollar, the payoffs have the interpretation of
excess returns. The excess return on a pair during a trading interval is computed as the reinvested payoffs during the trading interval.5 In particular, the long and short portfolio positions are marked-to-market daily. The daily returns on the long and short positions are calculated as value-weighted returns in the following way:}

\bblue{
$$
r_{P, t}=\frac{\sum_{i \in P} w_{i, t} r_{i, t}}{\sum_{i \in \mathrm{P} w_{i, t}}} 
$$
$$
w_{i, t}=w_{i, t-1}\left(1+r_{i, t-1}\right)=\left(1+r_{i, 1}\right) \cdots\left(1+r_{i, t-1}\right)
$$
}

\bblue{where $r$ defines returns and $w$ defines weights, and the daily returns are compounded to obtain monthly returns. This has the simple interpretation of a buy-and-hold strategy.}

As in \cite{Gatev2006}, 
\bblue{we consider two measures of excess return on a portfolio of pairs: the return on committed capital and the fully invested return, that is, the return on actual employed capital. The former scales the portfolio payoffs by the number of pairs that are selected for trading, the latter divides the payoffs by the number of pairs that open during the trading period. The
former measure of excess return is clearly more conservative: if a pair does not trade for the whole of the trading period, we still include a dollar of committed capital as the cumulative return in our calculation of excess
return. It takes into account the opportunity cost of hedge funds of having to commit capital to a strategy even if the strategy does not trade. To the extent that hedge funds are flexible in their sources and uses of funds, computing excess return relative to the actual capital employed may give a more realistic measure of the trading profits.}

\bblue{We initiate the pairs strategy by trading the pairs at the beginning of every month in the sample period, with the exception of the first 12 months, which are needed to estimate pairs for the strategy starting in the first month. The result is a time series of overlapping six-month
trading period excess returns. We correct for the correlation induced by overlap by averaging monthly returns across trading strategies that start one month apart as in Jegadeesh and Titman (1993). The resulting time series has the interpretation of the payoffs to a proprietary trading
desk, which delegates the management of the six portfolios to six different traders whose formation and trading periods are staggered by one month.}
