\begin{frame}{History of Pairs Trading}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed by a group of ``\textit{quants}'' at Morgan Stanley in the 1980s. 
\medskip
\begin{itemize}
\item Pioneered by Gerry Bamberger 
\item Advanced by a team of mathematicians and physicists led by Nunzio Tartaglia
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\item In 1987, Morgan Stanley  made \$50 mill. on Tartaglia's team's automated systems 
%(an outstanding profit at the time)
\smallskip
\item Although the Morgan Stanley group disbanded in 1989 after a period of performance, \textbf{pairs trading has since become an increasingly popular ``market-neutral'' investment strategy} used by  hedge funds, individual and institutional traders,.
%\item For a considerable time, pairs trading was a closely guarded secret used by Wall Street professionals and institutional investors. 
%\item More hedge funds started to employ this strategy: D.E. Shaw (now TwoSigma) and Long-Term Capital Management
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Theoretical Underpinnings: \textsc{Asset Pricing}}

Asset Pricing can be viewed in \textbf{absolute} and \textbf{relative} terms:


        \begin{itemize} 
        \item \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{Absolute pricing}} $\Rightarrow$ securities are valued from \textbf{fundamentals}, such as disconted future cash flows
        
        \medskip
        \item \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{Relative pricing}} $\Rightarrow$   two securities that are \textbf{close substitutes} for each other should sell for the \textbf{same price} (\textit{it does not say what that price should be!})
        

\begin{itemize}
        \medskip
        \item  The \textbf{L}aw of \textbf{O}ne \textbf{P}rice  is applicable to relative pricing (\textit{even if that price is wrong!})
        
        \medskip
        \item According to Ingersoll (1987), the LOP is the proposition that ``\textit{two investments with the same payoff in every state of nature must have the same current value}''. 

        \medskip
        \item In other words, two securities with the \textbf{same payoffs} in all states of the world should sell for the \textbf{same price}
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Theoretical Underpinnings: \textsc{Co-Integration}}

\begin{itemize}
        \item Pairs trading can be justified within an \textbf{Equilibrium Asset-Pricing framework with nonstationary common factors}

        \medskip
        \item If the long and short components fluctuate with common nonstationary factors, then the \textbf{prices of the component portfolios} (\textit{aka the spread}) would be \textbf{co-integrated} and the pairs trading strategy would be expected to work.
        
        \medskip 
        \item To interpret a pair $(i,j)$ as co-integrated prices, we need to assume that there exists a \textbf{co-integrating vector that has only two nonzero coordinates}: $$\boldsymbol \alpha = \mathbf e_i - \mathbf e_j$$

%        \smallskip
        \item In that case, the sum or difference of scaled prices will be \textbf{reverting to zero} and a trading rule could be constructed to exploit the expected temporary deviations.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%		\begin{itemize} 
%		\item \textbf{Absolute pricing}: values securities from fundamentals such as disc. future cash flow
%		\item \textbf{Relative pricing}:  means that two
%securities that are close substitutes for each other should sell for the same price (it does not say what that price will be)
%		\item  The \textbf{L}aw of \textbf{O}ne \textbf{P}rice  is applicable to relative pricing, even if that price is wrong.
%\begin{itemize}
%		\item According to Ingersoll (1987), the LOP is the proposition that ``two investments with the same payoff in every state of nature must have the same
%current value''.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Their paper, \textit{``Pairs Trading: Performance of a Relative-Value Arbitrage Rule''} is the most-cited and seminal work in the literature.
            \smallskip
            \item First circulated as a working paper in 1999 and later published in the \textit{Review of Financial Studies} (2006).
            \smallskip
            \item It provided the \textbf{first large-scale, rigorous empirical evidence of the strategy's historical profitability}, establishing it as a legitimate field of study.

        \item \textbf{\cite{Do2010}}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item In their \textit{Financial Analysts Journal} article, they re-examined the GGR strategy with an extended dataset running through 2009.
            \smallskip
            \item They confirmed that profitability was steadily \textbf{decaying}, likely due to the strategy's popularity and increasing market efficiency.
            \smallskip
            \item However, they also discovered that profits temporarily \textbf{resurged} during periods of market turmoil, such as the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC).

\begin{itemize}
    \item Limited to finding \textbf{one single substitute} security for any target asset

\end{itemize}

\bigskip 
\textbf{A More Flexible Approach}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Instead of searching for one perfect substitute, why not construct a \textbf{synthetic replica} using multiple securities?

\medskip
\item \textbf{Example - General Motors}: Rather than finding a single stock that tracks GM's movements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use a \textbf{linear combination} of multiple securities
    \item Create a more accurate synthetic substitute  
    \item Capture complex relationships that no single stock can replicate

%\begin{frame}{Can we reframe the idea of Pairs Trading?}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Traditional pairs trading imposes a severe cardinality constraint by limiting the replication of a target asset to a single substitute security. 
%\item This restriction, while conceptually elegant, may be unnecessarily limiting in practice. 
%\item Consider General Motors: rather than searching for a single stock whose normalized price series closely tracks GM's movements, we could construct a synthetic replica using a linear combination of multiple securities. 
%\item This approach maintains the fundamental economic intuition of pairs trading--exploiting temporary deviations between economically related assets--while providing greater flexibility in replica construction.
%\end{itemize}
%\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\begin{frame}{Generalizing Pairs Trading: A Replicating Portfolio approach}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The theoretical foundation remains rooted in relative pricing theory, where securities serving as close economic substitutes should exhibit similar price dynamics. However, our framework relaxes the stringent requirement that such substitution be achieved through a single asset. Instead, we allow for the construction of synthetic substitutes through sparse linear combinations, potentially improving the replication of the target asset.
%
%\item This paper proposes a generalization of the pairs trading framework that relaxes this rigid cardinality constraint. Instead of searching for a single, naturally occurring substitute for a target asset, we propose to construct a ``synthetic replica'' of it. Methodologically, this is achieved by regressing the normalized price series of the target asset against a broad ``donor pool'' of potential substitutes. The fitted values from this regression form the price series of the synthetic replica --a portfolio of assets weighted to best track the target. The spread in this generalized framework is therefore the regression error: the price difference between the target asset and its synthetic replica.

\section{Methodology}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Pairs Trading as a Replicating Portfolio problem}
\begin{itemize}
\item The economic intuition behind pairs trading --exploit temporary mispricing between two close substitutes-- can be cast more generally as a problem of \emph{relative valuation}.  

\medskip
\item Rather than forcing the substitute for a target stock $i$ to be a \emph{single} partner, we allow it to be a \emph{replicating portfolio}: a linear combination of securities whose joint price path mimics that of $i$.
%----------------------------------------------------
\begin{equation} \label{eq:regression}
p_{i,t}= \sum_{j\in\mathcal D} \beta_j\,p_{j,t}+ \varepsilon_{i,t},
\qquad t=0,\dots,T ,
\end{equation}
%----------------------------------------------------
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $p_{i,t}$ represents the \textit{normalized price} (i.e.: cumulative return) of the target asset
%\footnote{
%The normalized price time series of a stock $i$ is built from a position where 1 dollar is invested at the beginning of the estimation window. Formally, letting $r_{i,0}=0$, the normalized price time series at time $t$ is:
%$$
%p_{i,t} = \prod_{\tau=0}^t (1+r_{i,\tau} )
%$$
%}, 
\item $\mathcal{D}$ denotes the donor pool of potential replicating assets, and 
\item $\varepsilon_{i,t}$ denotes the spread between the target and its synthetic replica. 
\end{itemize}

%Traders should then be interested in trading the spread between the target stock and the replicating portfolio, which is simply the residual error $\varepsilon_{i,t}$, by betting on its mean-reversion. 
%
%While \cref{eq:general_reg} describes the unrestricted case, where no structure is imposed in the replicating portfolio, we can show that a restricted version from this general framework delivers the classical pairs trading methodology. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Recasting Gatev's Pairs Trading as a Replicating Portfolio problem}

Note that traditional pairs trading, as described in Gatev et al, is a special case where the regression coefficient vector is restricted to the canonical basis. 
\bigskip 

\begin{itemize}
%\begin{itemize}
\item Let $\mathcal B:=\{\mathbf e_1,\mathbf e_2,\dots,\mathbf e_{|\mathcal D|}\}$, denote the canonical basis of $\mathbb R^{|{\mathcal D}|}$. 

\bigskip
\item ``Traditional'' pairs trading fixes a target stock $i$ and selects a single-asset replicating portfolio in a 1-to-1 relationship by imposing the restriction $\boldsymbol \beta \in \mathcal B$.

%\item Note that, for $\lambda$ close to 0, the lasso penalization is very small, so our replicating portfolio will be composed of a large amount of assets. In the limit, $\lambda=0$ and we recover \ref{eq:regression}; in this case, the average number of stocks in the replicating portfolio averages 200 stocks, which becomes too unwieldy and costly to trade (transaction costs rapidly explode). 
%\item On the other hand, for large $\lambda$ we recover sparser solutions. In our applications we experiment with a grid of $\lambda$ values and report all of them to show that results are robust to the choice of this hyperparameter. 
%\item For our empirical application, we will set $\lambda=0.01$, which delivers replicating portfolios composed of 15 stocks on average. 
%\item The strategy is robust to different values of $\lambda$

        \item Lower transaction costs
        \item \textcolor{darkred}{\textbf{Risk:}} Degradation in replication quality

\textbf{Our Empirical Choice}: $\lambda = 0.01$
\begin{itemize}

\section{Empirical Application}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Data}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We work with CRSP daily files from January 1st 1962 to December 31st 2024. 
	\item Exchanges: NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ (exchange codes 1, 2, and 3)
	\item Common stocks (share codes 10 and 11)
\end{itemize}
	
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Sample splits}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Our empirical design retains the two-stage rolling-window approach of \cite{Gatev2006}. 

	\bigskip
	\item For every month in the sample we:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item  Estimate the strategy over a 12-month \emph{formation window} and then,
	\item Trade the resulting spreads during the subsequent 6-month \emph{trading window}.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Formation window (12 months)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item During each formation period, we define our universe of stocks by filtering out from CRSP any security that exhibits at least one non-trading day in that period. 

$$
\mathcal U = \{ j: \exists \; r_{j,t} \; \forall t\in \mathcal T_{for} \} 
$$

\medskip
\item Then, for every stock in this universe we construct its ``\textit{normalized price}`` as the cumulative return. This tracks the value of investing 1\$ in the stock at the start of the window and continuously reinvest cash dividends. Set $r_{j,0}=0$, then:

$$
p_{j,t} = \prod_{\tau=0}^t (1+r_{j,\tau})
,
\quad t\in \mathcal T_{for}
$$
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Formation window (12 months)}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item We treat each stock $i\in \mathcal U$ as a potential target and construct its  replicating portfolio from the donor pool $\mathcal D_i=\mathcal U\setminus\{i\}$ 
%----------------------------------------------------
$$
\widehat{\boldsymbol \beta_i}
:=
\underset{\boldsymbol \beta \in \mathbb R^{|{\mathcal D_i}|}} {\arg\min}
\left\{ 
\sum_{t\in\mathcal T_{for}}
\Bigl( 
p_{i,t} - \sum_{j \in \mathcal{D}_i} \beta_j p_{j,t}
\Bigr)^2 
+ 
\lambda \sum_{j \in \mathcal{D}_i} |\beta_j| 
\right\}
$$
%----------------------------------------------------
%\item The object of interest is the spread 
%$$
%\varepsilon_{i,t} := p_{i,t} - \sum_{j \in \mathcal{D}} \beta_j p_{j,t} 
%$$
\item We rank ``pairs'' in ascending order of MSE
$$
\text{rank}(i) = 
\sum_{j\in \mathcal U} \mathbf 1 \{MSE_i \geq  MSE_j\}
$$
where $MSE_i := \sum_{t\in \mathcal T_{for}}(p_{i,t} - \sum_{j \in \mathcal{D}_i} \beta_j p_{j,t})^2 $
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Trading window (6 months)}
\begin{itemize}
\item The trading window commences on the first day following the formation period. 
\item The trading object is the spread between the target and its replicating portfolio
$$
\varepsilon_{i,t} := p_{i,t} - \sum_{j \in \mathcal{D}_i} \beta_j p_{j,t}
$$
\item The trading rule capitalizes on the expected mean reversion of the spread:  \textcolor{gray!77}{$\varepsilon_{i,t} \sim I(0)$}
\item We initiate a dollar-neutral position whenever it widens beyond two historical standard deviations (estimated in the formation window)
$$
TR(\varepsilon_{i,t}) = \left\{
\begin{array}{lll}
\textsc{long} & \text{if} & \epsilon_{i,t} < -2 \hat \sigma_i
%\\
%\textsc{none} & \text{if} & |\epsilon_{i,t}| < 2 \hat \sigma_i
\\
\textsc{short} & \text{if} & \epsilon_{i,t} > +2 \hat \sigma_i
\\
\textsc{neutral} & \text{if} & \text{else}
\end{array}
\right.$$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Trading window (6 months)}
\begin{itemize}
\item This trading strategy involves shorting 1\$ of the \textit{relatively overvalued} asset and simultaneously longing 1\$ in the \textit{relatively undervalued} asset. 

\medskip
\item The position is \textbf{closed} when the \textbf{spread mean reverts} (i.e., prices cross)

\medskip
\item If a \textbf{position} is \textbf{still open at the end of the 6-month} trading window, it is \textbf{liquidated at the prevailing market prices}.

\medskip 
\item If a constituent stock is \textbf{delisted}, the position is closed out using the \textbf{delisting return} or the last available price.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\begin{frame}{Payoffs}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Positions may open, close, and reopen multiple times within the 6-month window.
%\item The payoffs from this strategy are equivalent to excess returns, as they are derived from self-financing, dollar-neutral positions. 
%\item The total excess return for each target-replica strategy over the trading period is the sum of its reinvested payoffs. 
%\item Positions are marked-to-market daily, and the daily returns on the long and short portfolios are compounded to calculate monthly returns, which mirrors a buy-and-hold approach for the underlying assets.
%\item The realized payoffs from this strategy are characterized by a sequence of cash flows: 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item positive flows accrue when a spread opens and converges within the trading window
%\item unresolved spreads generate a final cash flow at the end of the period. 
%\item if no divergence occurs, no trade is initiated. 
%\end{itemize}
%\end{itemize}
%\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Payoffs}
\begin{itemize}
\item Returns are computed as \textbf{excess returns}, with all positions \textbf{marked to market} daily and returns \textbf{compounded to the monthly level}. 

\medskip 
\item Specifically, the daily return on a portfolio $P$ is calculated as
%----------------------------------------------------
$$
r_{P, t} = \frac{\sum_{i \in P} w_{i, t} r_{i, t}}{\sum_{i \in P} w_{i, t}}
\quad \quad \text{where} \quad \quad 
w_{i, t} = w_{i, t-1}(1 + r_{i, t-1}) = \prod_{s=1}^{t-1} (1 + r_{i, s})
$$
%----------------------------------------------------
\begin{itemize}
	\item $r_{i, t}$ denotes the return 
	\item $w_{i, t}$ is the evolving weight of asset $i$ at time $t$. 
\end{itemize}

\medskip 
\item This approach is equivalent to a \textbf{buy-and-hold strategy}, with daily returns compounded to obtain monthly performance.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Excess-return metrics}
Following \cite{Gatev2006}, we report two measures of excess return:
\bigskip 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Return on \textcolor{blue}{committed} capital}. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item It assumes 1\$ is allocated to every pair selected for trading (regardless of whether a trade was triggered)
	\item Conservative metric: reflects the opportunity cost of capital commitment
%	\item That is, it divides aggregate pay-offs by the number of spreads selected for trading, charging the strategy for capital tied up even if a spread never opens.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
\item \textbf{Return on \textcolor{blue}{fully invested} capital}. 
\begin{itemize}
\item It assumes 1\$ is allocated only to pairs that trigger a trade
\item Reflects the viewpoint of a flexible trading desk that is able to redeploy idle funds
%\item It scales payoffs by the actual capital deployed in open trades. 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Overlapping portfolios}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
To generate a continuous time series of returns, we initiate this entire process at the beginning of every month in our sample (excluding the initial 12 months required for the first formation period). This creates a series of overlapping 6-month trading periods. 

\medskip
\item To correct for the serial correlation induced by this overlap, we follow the standard procedure of averaging the monthly returns across all strategies that are concurrently active, as in Jegadeesh (1993).

\medskip
\item The resulting series can be interpreted as the net payoff to a trading desk managing six distinct portfolios, with each portfolio staggered by one month.
\end{itemize}
