\small\textit{Note}: 
This table presents trading intensity metrics for both Greedy and Stable algorithms across different data splits. 
The metrics are computed at a daily frequency. The `\# Open Positions' columns report position-related statistics: 
`Avg.' shows the mean number of concurrent open positions per day, `Std.' represents their standard deviation, while 
`Max' and `Min' indicate the maximum and minimum number of positions held simultaneously. Under `Trading Activity (\%)', 
`Turnover' is calculated as the sum of absolute changes in position sizes divided by the total portfolio size, expressed 
as a percentage; formally, $Turnover_t = 100 \times (\sum_i |w_{i,t} - w_{i,t-1}|)/(\sum_i |w_{i,t}|)$, where $w_{i,t}$ 
represents the position size in asset $i$ at time $t$. `Changes/Pos.' represents the average number of modifications per 
position per day, computed as the daily turnover divided by the average number of positions, providing insight into how 
actively individual positions are managed. The `Trading Costs (\%)' section reports `Cost' as the average daily implementation 
shortfall (computed as the difference between gross and net returns) expressed in percentage terms, while `Active' shows 
the percentage of trading days with at least one open position. All metrics are first computed daily and then averaged 
over their respective periods, except for Max and Min positions which represent the absolute extremes over each period.
