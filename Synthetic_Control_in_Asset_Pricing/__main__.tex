\begin{abstract}
This paper develops a novel framework for applying the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) to asset pricing and portfolio management. We extend the traditional SCM methodology by incorporating financial market features, including short-selling capabilities and regularization techniques to manage transaction costs and portfolio concentration. The framework is further enhanced through machine learning approaches that capture nonlinear relationships between financial instruments. We demonstrate the method's versatility through various applications, including statistical arbitrage, hedging of complex securities, ETF replication, and risk analysis. Our methodology provides practitioners with a systematic approach to construct synthetic portfolios that closely track target instruments while maintaining implementation feasibility through controlled trading costs and portfolio turnover. 
%The empirical results suggest that our enhanced SCM framework outperforms traditional linear methods, particularly in markets characterized by complex, nonlinear relationships.
