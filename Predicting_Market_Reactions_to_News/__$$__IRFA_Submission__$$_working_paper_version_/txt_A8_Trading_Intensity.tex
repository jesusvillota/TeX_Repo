\subsection{Trading Intensity} \label{sec:A8}
The extraordinary performance of our proposed LLM-based methodology warrants a careful examination of its implementation costs and practical viability. While our primary objective has been to develop a framework that better captures the economic content of news articles and their subsequent market impact, the practical implementation of such strategies necessarily involves trading frictions that could affect their real-world efficacy. In this section, we analyze the trading intensity patterns of both methodologies to provide a more complete assessment of their relative merits and to understand how transaction costs might influence their comparative advantages.
We begin by examining the temporal evolution of open positions for both approaches, which provides insights into their underlying trading dynamics and stability characteristics. This analysis is followed by detailed trading intensity metrics and concludes with a reassessment of portfolio statistics after accounting for transaction costs.

{\footnotesize\textit{Note: 
This figure shows the daily evolution of the number of open positions for both Greedy (blue) and Stable (green) algorithms across different data splits (Train, Validation, Test) using KMeans clustering (Panel A) and LLM clustering (Panel B). The time period spans from July 2020 to September 2021. Vertical dashed lines separate the different data splits. The Greedy algorithm selects clusters that maximize (minimize) the cluster-average-$SR$ for long (short) positions, while the Stable algorithm minimizes the rank difference between training and validation rankings. The number of traded clusters is $\theta = 0.5k=13$ for KMeans ($k^*=26$ clusters) and $\theta = 0.5k=10$ for LLM ($k^*=20$ clusters).

The temporal evolution of open positions, as illustrated in \cref{fig:open_positions_comparison},  reveals fundamental differences in the stability and reliability of trading signals generated by KMeans versus LLM-based clustering approaches. The KMeans implementation exhibits pronounced volatility in position management, particularly evident in the Greedy algorithm's behavior, which shows extreme fluctuations ranging from 6 to 105 positions. This erratic pattern suggests that KMeans-detected clusters are highly sensitive to market noise and potentially capture transient correlations rather than fundamental relationships. The substantial divergence between Greedy and Stable algorithms under KMeans further underscores the method's instability, as even minor variations in cluster selection criteria lead to dramatically different trading decisions.
%
In stark contrast, the LLM-based approach demonstrates remarkably more coherent and stable position management. Both Greedy and Stable algorithms maintain more closely aligned position counts, typically ranging between 20 and 75 positions, with highly correlated temporal movements. This convergence in behavior between algorithms suggests that LLM-identified clusters capture more fundamental and persistent market relationships. Particularly telling is the test period performance, where KMeans exhibits increased position volatility and extreme spikes, while the LLM approach maintains consistent position patterns across both algorithms. This stability in the out-of-sample period provides strong evidence that LLM-derived signals, grounded in economic analysis of firm-specific shocks, generalize more effectively to unseen data.

The trading intensity metrics, detailed in \cref{tab:trading_intensity_comparison}, provide quantitative validation of the structural differences between KMeans and LLM clustering approaches. Under KMeans, the dramatic disparity between Greedy and Stable algorithms (averaging 40.1 versus 10.77 positions, with standard deviations of 18.59 and 6.41 respectively) reflects the method's fundamental instability. More concerning is the Stable algorithm's exceptionally high Changes/Position ratio (3.228 versus 0.798 for Greedy), indicating frequent position adjustments necessitated by the transient nature of KMeans-identified clusters.
The LLM implementation demonstrates substantially more balanced and stable metrics across both algorithms. Average position counts converge (31.8 for Greedy, 26.61 for Stable) with more moderate standard deviations (14.84 and 12.16), suggesting that both aggressive and conservative cluster selection approaches identify similar, fundamentally-driven trading opportunities. The more balanced Changes/Position ratios (1.234 and 1.473) and consistent turnover rates (approximately 39\% for both algorithms) indicate that LLM-identified clusters require less frequent rebalancing, supporting the hypothesis that they capture more persistent market relationships.
% These patterns become particularly pronounced in the test period, where KMeans shows increased turnover (reaching 39.30\% for Stable) and position volatility, while the LLM approach maintains more stable trading activity (37.56\% and 37.85\% turnover for Greedy and Stable). This superior out-of-sample stability provides compelling evidence that LLM's economic approach to cluster identification produces more robust and generalizable trading signals compared to the purely statistical approach of KMeans.

Finally, the introduction of trading costs impacts the performance metrics of both clustering approaches (see \cref{tab:portfolio_statistics_comparison_net}), though with notably different implications for their practical viability. The KMeans-based strategy exhibits visible performance degradation, particularly evident in the test period where both algorithms generate losses (Greedy: -4.1\%, Stable: -6.8\% average annual returns). This deterioration is accompanied by elevated risk metrics, with the Stable algorithm showing particularly concerning characteristics including high standard deviation (14.2\%) and extreme kurtosis (14.74) in the test period, suggesting frequent occurrence of extreme returns.
In contrast, the LLM-based approach demonstrates superior resilience to trading costs, maintaining more stable performance characteristics across all periods. Most notably, in the test period, the strategy maintains its positive performance (Greedy: 19.0\%, Stable: 24.7\% annual returns) with substantially lower risk metrics (standard deviations of 6.2\% and 7.0\% respectively). The LLM approach's more moderate VaR and CVaR measures compared to KMeans further underscore its superior risk management characteristics under transaction costs.
This stark contrast in net performance can be attributed to the fundamentally different nature of the signals generated by each approach. While KMeans' statistically-driven clusters require frequent rebalancing that amplifies transaction costs, the LLM's economically-motivated clusters appear to identify more persistent price patterns that remain profitable even after accounting for trading frictions. However, it is worth noting that neither approach was explicitly optimized for transaction cost efficiency, suggesting potential for further improvement through cost-aware portfolio construction. These results highlight that while our LLM-based news parser successfully captures predictable market reactions to news articles, practitioners implementing such strategies would benefit from incorporating transaction costs into their optimization framework.
