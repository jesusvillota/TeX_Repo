\hspace{0.5cm} This paper employs a dataset of Spanish business news articles sourced from Dow Jones Newswires, covering the period from June 24, 2020, to September 30, 2021. The selection of this timeframe is deliberate, driven by two key considerations. 
%
First, given the substantial computational demands of LLM-based analysis, we strategically focus on a smaller, carefully curated dataset. This deliberate scope reduction allows us to thoroughly demonstrate our novel methodology's effectiveness in decoding market-news relationships while keeping computational costs manageable. Rather than pursuing a broad-scale analysis, we prioritize proving our approach's utility through a focused, computationally feasible study that can serve as a foundation for future expansions.
%
%First, we aim to test a novel methodology on a relatively small dataset to ensure feasibility and demonstrate its utility in understanding market reactions to news. Our goal is not to conduct a big data analysis, but rather to showcase the methodology's potential on a manageable dataset. 
%
Second, we specifically chose the Covid-19 era to test our methodology's extrapolative capabilities during periods of significant market instability and volatility. While existing textual algorithms typically perform well in stable market conditions, they often struggle to generalize effectively during periods of heightened uncertainty. By focusing on this volatile period, we can better assess our methodology's robustness and its ability to maintain predictive power under challenging market conditions.
%Second, to evaluate the extrapolative power of the proposed methodology, it is important that the data span a period characterized by instability and volatility, which is why we focus on the Covid-19 era. Notably, textual algorithms are able to extrapolate well out of sample under relatively stable time periods, however, when challenged in uncertain or volatile periods, they tend to fail to generalize well out of sample.

The dataset consists of high-quality articles that have been filtered to include only those mentioning Spanish publicly traded firms listed on the IBEX-35 index. These 35 companies represent the largest firms in Spain by market capitalization and are typically the most liquid and actively traded Spanish stocks. Moreover, these companies tend to receive the most consistent media coverage, making them ideal for the scope of our analysis.

The use of Dow Jones Newswires as our news source is also intentional. Dow Jones has a standard practice of including the stock market ticker of firms directly affected by the article in parentheses, while excluding firms mentioned for secondary purposes from ticker specification.
This feature significantly facilitates the extraction of named entities (i.e., Named Entity Recognition, or NER). The tickers used by Dow Jones align with those from Yahoo Finance, enabling seamless integration between our NER algorithm and subsequent firm-specific trading operations via the Yahoo Finance API.

We employ a pattern recognition algorithm through the \texttt{regex} library in Python to identify specific mentions of publicly traded companies in the Spanish stock exchange. The algorithm searches for patterns of the form ``\texttt{(<WORD>.MC)}'' for any \texttt{<WORD>}. For instance, consider the following example article (translated into English for convenience):

{ACS and Acciona Secure Contracts for New Australian Airport 
%Worth EUR164 Million
}
A consortium of Actividades de Construcción y Servicios SA \red{(ACS.MC)} and Acciona SA \red{(ANA.MC)} has won a contract to build the operations area of the Western Sydney International Airport (Nancy-Bird Walton) and carry out paving works, amounting to AUD265 million (EUR164 million) for the Australian subsidiary CIMIC Group Ltd (CIM.AU). CIMIC will carry out the work through its subsidiary CPB Contractors, as stated in a press release. This is the third project awarded by Western Sydney Airport to the joint venture after being selected to carry out earthworks.
%The scope of the works includes paving of runways and taxiways, aircraft isolation platforms, lateral roads, landscaping, aeronautical lighting systems, associated buildings of the electrical substation, as well as other specialized systems.
Construction will take two years, and the Western Sydney airport is expected to open in 2026.

%Spain's Inclusion in German Risk Zones List Will Have Limited Impact
%}
%The decision by Germany to add all of Spain to its list of risk zones will have a \qquote{limited impact, as, for now, only travel advisories have been issued and the requirements, if traveling to Spain, are reduced to taking a negative PCR test upon return or a complete immunization test,} Sabadell states. However, \qquote{if this changes and new restrictions are announced, it would be very negative for hotel companies}, especially for Meliá (MEL.MC), particularly if it affects the Balearic and Canary Islands, the entity indicates. \qquote{It would leave recovery in the hands of national demand, which represents only around 30\% of total overnight stays,} it points out. German tourism accounts for 11\% of Meliá's EBIT. In contrast, for NH (NHH.MC) the possible effect \qquote{is residual} due to its urban hotel business model, says Sabadell, which also does not foresee a potential impact for IAG (IAG.MC).

Our NER algorithm applied to  Article \ref{news:article-acs-acciona} successfully identifies the Spanish firms \texttt{ACS.MC} (Actividades de Construcción y Servicios SA) and \texttt{ANA.MC} (Acciona SA) while disregarding the Australian \texttt{CIM.AU} (CIMIC Groups Ltd). 
To further ensure the reliability of firm identification, we validate the extracted entities using a Large Language Model (LLM).
%To enhance the reliability of firm identification, we further validate the extracted entities using a Large Language Model (LLM).
In particular, we feed the articles to the LLM, which parses them according to a predefined schema. As we will see later, the first task in this schema 
is to identify the listed Spanish firms directly affected by the events described in the article. Finally, the identified firms are filtered against a dynamic list of IBEX-35 members.
%is to identify all the Spanish firms listed on the IBEX-35 that are directly affected by the shocks described in the news article. 
Due to the high quality of the dataset, the correlation between entities identified by the LLM and those extracted via pattern recognition is almost exact.

For subsequent analysis, we partition the dataset into three splits: \textit{Train}, \textit{Validation}, and \textit{Test}. Each split serves a distinct purpose that will be explained in detail as we progress through the paper. Summary statistics for each data split are provided in \cref{tab:Articles_Summary_Statistics}.

The distribution of the number of articles published per day is illustrated in \cref{fig:hist_1}, showing that the most frequent publication rate is between 5 and 10 articles per day, though some days exhibit unusually high publication counts. \cref{fig:hist_2} shows the distribution of the number of words per article, with the majority of articles containing between 70 and 280 words. This indicates that the articles are relatively succinct, providing direct information. 
However, the long right tail points to instances of more comprehensive coverage.
