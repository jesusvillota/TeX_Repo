This paper introduces a novel methodology for constructing and analyzing firm networks using Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to news article data. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on simple co-occurrence patterns, our method leverages LLMs to detect and classify meaningful economic relationships between firms. The framework identifies six distinct types of firm relationships: supplier-customer, competitive, partnership, mergers and acquisitions, legal disputes, and other interactions. We develop a mathematical framework that incorporates both directionality (asymmetric relationships) and reflexivity (self-relationships), resulting in a multi-layered network representation. Each layer corresponds to a specific relationship type, with edges weighted by LLM-derived relationship scores. Our methodology enables dynamic network analysis, tracking how firm relationships evolve over time and respond to external events. This enhanced network representation offers new insights into supply chain structures, competitive landscapes, and the propagation of economic shocks through firm networks.

%This paper introduces a comprehensive and nuanced approach to constructing firm networks from business news articles by leveraging LLMs to detect and classify firm relationships. By incorporating relationship types, directionality, and reflexivity, the proposed methodology provides a rich framework for analyzing firm interactions and market dynamics. The resulting multi-layered, directed- and undirected network allows for advanced analysis of firm relationships, providing insights into how firms navigate competitive environments, form partnerships, and manage internal actions.
